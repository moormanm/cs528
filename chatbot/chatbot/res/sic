Year after year, twenty-something women come to New York City in search of the two "L's": labels and love.
Twenty years ago.
I was one of them.
Having gotten the knack for labels early.
I concentrated on my search for love.
That is why you need help to spot them.
Lots of help.
Year after year, my single girlfriends were my salvation.
And, as it turns out.
My meal ticket.
We still are those four single girls.
Even though, technically.
we're not.
One of us is married.
One of us.
married, divorced and re-married.
One of us.
relocated.
And.
one of us stayed exactly where she was.
In love.
I got a good feeling about this one, kid.
I've always loved this block.
Finding the perfect apartment in New York City is like finding the perfect partner.
It can take years.
How many does this make?
This is thirty-three.
Lucky thirty-three!
The worst.
I just left you a message.
Thirty-four.
Lucky thirty-four?
If anything else opens up let us know.
We're very interested in this building.
I do have another apartment that's not even on the market yet.
Care to take a look?
Sure.
It's more than you were looking to pay.
How much more?
More.
Oh, so this is where they keep the light.
And this is the master bedroom.
Hideous.
Hate it.
Hurts my eyes.
How is this place even available?
Nasty divorce.
If you live here what is there to fight about?
This is the master closet?
No.
Yes.
Small for a room this size.
I know.
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Now, I understand the divorce.
I can build you a better closet.
Welcome home, baby.
Can we afford this?
I got it.
"I got it.
" Just like that.
"I got it" like he was picking up the check for coffee or something.
It sounds perfect.
Except for the closet which Big says he can redo also he says the kitchen needs work but I don't know about that `cause I keep sweaters in my stove.
So, he bought it and you're going to live there with him?
Yes, together.
That's right.
But he'll own it.
So.
You are keeping your own place, right?
Oh, Miranda, please, I haven't figured out all the details yet, but I'm a smart girl and I'm sure I'll figure out something I'm comfortable with.
I just want to make sure you're being smart here And I love you for it but for now can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel.
Jealous.
Jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.
Fine.
I'm jealous.
You're in real estate heaven and I'm in Brooklyn.
New York magazine said Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.
Whoever wrote that - lives in Brooklyn.
There she is.
Hey Hollywood!
Samantha Jones.
Smith Jerrod's manager I'm in New York `till Monday.
How was your flight?
Fabulous.
Let's go in I am so excited!
It was a rare occasion that brought all types of women together.
The socialites, the trendies the yuppies, the yentas.
Why the pushing?
Great.
Can't wait.
Don't you ever get weirded out by seeing Smith in bed with all those other women?
No, I think it's hot.
Sometimes, when I'm alone, I masturbate right along with them.
And people say the golden age of television is over.
Besides, it's fake sex.
When they're doing it no one's actually turned on.
Kinda like Steve and I.
I'm kidding.
But come one it's been seven years.
He does that, I do this.
It's not like a new plot twist is going to turn up.
Next item.
The flower ring.
If Schadenfreude is the word for feeling pleasure at someone else misfortune This was "jewelryfreude.
" Do I hear forty?
Do I hear forty fi Fifty?
Sex with only one man for I don't know how long.
Do I hear fifty thousand?
Fifty fucking thousand!
Fifty-five?
Sixty?
Sixty to our colorful bidder?
I draw the line at fifty.
I thought this auction would be more fun.
but it's kinda sad.
Isn't it?
I thought it was just sad for me `cause I know her.
But it's really sad, huh?
And it's funny cause they were so happy.
Till they weren't I know, right?
We all told her to get married but she didn't want to push him.
He'd been married three other times.
So, she let it ride and then she came home one night and he had locked her out.
She didn't even have anywhere to live.
After ten years.
Such a shame.
She was a smart girl till she fell in love.
The creatures are ready.
Just gonna sit there?
I'm not sitting, I'm thinking.
Here.
Husk and think.
So, the other night, Big and I were talking about, you know, moving in together and our future.
And about what makes sense as we move forward.
And, well.
we decided to get married.
and I'm deaf.
Everyone's looking Sorry!
I'm sorry.
but my friend here, just got engaged and she's been going out with the man for ten years.
I am mortified.
There is literally a ringing in my ear.
Samantha Jones Well.
I made a little decision that I hope you'll be happy about.
Oh, honey.
you finally got Botox.
No.
I did not get Botox I'm telling you, Carrie you'll love it.
I did not call to talk about Botox.
I'm just saying.
So.
Last week, after the auction, I started thinking about my options.
Right.
Right, and.
well, Big and I decided to get married.
Really?
Yes.
That's great.
You sounded more excited about the botox.
Well, honey I am excited for you but you know me.
I don't really believe in marriage.
Botox on the other hand That works every time.
Honey, I've got to go.
The People magazine person is on hold.
Smith's on the short list to be their "Sexiest Man Alive.
" We can catch up when I'm in town next week.
Hello?
I think I was in shock.
I mean, it's you getting married.
This is not some random person it's you.
I hear ya.
And I guess, I thought that after that big mess with Aidan you'd never want to get married.
I know.
Well, I'm happy for you.
And one more thing.
I want you to be maid of honor.
How do you feel about that?
The same way you feel about Botox.
Painful and unnecessary.
74, 75, 76.
Seventy-six guests.
Seventy five sounds better.
"A small, wedding of seventy five guests.
" As a wedding gift, Charlotte had given me Anthony Marantino friend and wedding planner.
What?
She was borderline anyway.
Don't worry, I'll style it up with shoes.
The invitation is fancier than the dress.
I heard that.
And from Anthony Marantino to spaghetti marinara.
Where is he with the check?
Geese, Miranda relax.
Magda's not even finished yet.
I still have a legal brief to work on when I get home.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'll take him.
Wash that beautiful face too, yes?
What?
I'm sorry.
I'm exhausted.
Brady woke me up at five AM.
He woke me up too.
You got milk on your top lip.
What now?
It's like you're always criticizing me.
I am not.
You want to go through life with foam on your lip and no one telling you?
Anything you want to tell me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wait - wait Don't come already.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wait, wait get on top.
 Get on It's late.
let's just get it over with.
I mean We have to get up in four and half hours.
We never have sex and you want to get it over with?
Steve.
We have sex.
When was the last time we had sex?
There was snow on the ground.
How often do you guys have sex?
Miranda please.
What?
It's okay, I know all about sex.
Oh my.
But that's a dry spell.
I bet it is.
What about you and Big, Carrie?
Come on, I told.
Never.
But, I will tell you this.
When Big colors He rarely stays inside the lines.
Well, this was very helpful.
Send it to Smith Jerrod at the office address.
I've got to go.
Something just came up.
I've got a gift for you.
So far, I like it.
I have to be at the studio by six A.
M.
and I need to get a workout before that.
This is how it starts.
Next thing you know.
we're only having sex three or four times a week.
Most people consider that normal.
I am not most people.
No - you most certainly are not.
One glass of Merlot and two orgasms later.
And that is how Samantha learned she had a new neighbor.
John?
Lean?
Are you the last person in New York still taking out library books?
Hi.
You make me very happy.
Yeah, yeah.
Put it in writing.
Alright.
Here's a love letter from me to you.
Loving you.
Is easy.
`cause your beautiful.
EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE IS FILLED WITH LOVING YOU.
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
Which way's the wedding?
I've been thinking.
Again?
How about we get married at The New York Public Library?
Think how perfect.
You and I and our love story surrounded by all the other lesser love stories.
Do we have to make that big of a deal?
It's not that big a deal.
It's seventy-five people in a room that's partitioned in half.
It's just I've already had two big weddings.
Well, what did you have in mind?
I don't know a judge, couple friends and then we go for ham and eggs after.
Interesting.
Would we have to whisper?
In the library?
"The ultimate single gal Carrie Bradshaw will be married in Manolos to New York financier John James Preston come fall.
" Our wedding's on Page Six.
Who would put that in there?
"Proving to single gals everywhere that there can be a happy ending over forty.
" Oh, I know who.
Later that day, I met my friend Stanford for our weekly quick lunch and gossip session.
Also known as "dish then dash.
" It seemed everywhere I went.
people I knew were excited and available to come to the wedding.
You forgot to charge us for the gaggle of gays.
Carrie Bradshaw Preston!
Carrie Bradshaw Preston!
Mazel tov!
Saw you on Page Six!
September?
October?
When?
Look!
Will you look!
I got so excited no shoes.
I'm standing barefoot on a New York sidewalk probably getting trichinoses.
We're at the same address different floor.
Just send it they'll get us the invite.
The shocking thing was not the plethora of empty autumn social calenders but knowledge that everyone does indeed read Page Six.
Even people you didn't expect, like my Vogue editor, Enid.
We're putting together our annual "Age" issue and we'd like you to do forty.
Great.
Who am I interviewing?
No.
You.
You are forty.
I want you to be featured in the magazine as the forty year old and here's the brilliant twist bride.
Wait I would be in the magazine?
Appetizers with Oscar de la Renta.
Lunch with Lanvin.
And Lacroix.
And Dior.
And for dessert Vivienne Westwood.
Okay.
Open them.
Double door.
So far so good.
Well.
You did me proud, Mister.
Like it?
Like it?
It's love at first sight.
Now, I believe this is all really happening.
I can't believe it sold so fast.
It's a sign.
Yeah, a sign I priced it too low.
That's the food money on the table.
I'll get started in the closet.
I should be done in seventeen years.
Pink Post-it take.
Purple toss.
Yellow: Storage.
You're good friends.
Samantha!
Oh my God!
What are you doing here?
!
I lot of shit went down in this place.
Attention must be payed!
It took four friends, three days to put twenty years into twenty-eight boxes.
Who are you again?
Oh, you know me I'm your daughter-in-law.
I'm Miranda.
That's right.
While I run over to see your mother tomorrow maybe you can take him to the first birthday party alone.
Then I'll meet you at the twins' party and you can leave and be at the bar by six.
What's the matter?
Steve.
I had sex with someone else.
And you are so amazing with Ma and everything.
everything you do and I can't believe I would do that to you.
You and I hadn't had sex in a really long time and I It didn't mean anything It was just once.
and it's been killing me.
It's killing you?
!
It just happened.
I wasn't thinking.
Do not follow me.
Hi.
Surprise Here we are!
Well, I'm so excited you are here for a sleepover.
We are too.
Aren't we B-boy?
Here.
Mommy has to go to the bathroom.
Brady, do you want to go have some peanut butter?
Peanut butter it is.
Apparently you don't have sex for six months he runs out and has it with some girl at his bar.
Steve.
I can't believe it.
Steve.
Steve.
When I think of everything I've done for him.
And this is how he repays me.
Man, if I didn't have Brady, I would never go back there.
I don't know if this question is allowed but how is Steve handling this?
Says he's devastated begs me to forgive him.
Not going to happen.
I can barely even look at him.
Steve I can't believe it.
That's what I said.
Miranda, honey are you sure you want to do this?
It's just one time.
Anyone can have a slip.
Well, even if I could get my head around that justification it's the cheating part the behind my back part.
the violation of the trust that's the thing that's killing me.
Besides.
women who stay with men who cheat are women who are afraid to be on their own.
And that's not me I can handle it.
Always could.
Mommy, I want to go home.
But.
seriously, I'd rather know first.
You want me to tell you if I'm going to have sex?
Fine.
I'm about to have sex.
Thanks Anaka.
I don't know if Steve's mentioned anything to you yet about us.
Has he?
Well we've had some marriage problems it's not necessary to go into the details but I just wanted you to know that we won't be coming to see you together anymore.
I'll be here Monday, Wednesday and Sunday the other days will be Steve.
Who's Steve?
Miranda was starting to see the upside of Alzheimer's.
Up, up.
I have to finish this.
Up.
Hey.
I don't have time for this.
This is our wedding and you're not taking it seriously.
No, I'm not It's a circus!
Two hundred people Page Six This is my third marriage how do you think it makes me look?
I didn't know that was even an issue.
Why didn't you say anything sooner?
You wanted all this.
But don't you want I want you, Carrie.
That's what I want.
I would have just gone down to city hall.
I think it's too late for city hall now.
Well, no.
I wasn't suggesting I was just saying.
See.
That is the face I've been trying to avoid.
Come here.
You're a great man friend.
Now, I know it's tradition at the rehearsal dinner for the maid of honor to reveal embarrassing things about the bride.
But in our group .
We never kiss and tell.
So, I'd like to make a toast to the groom.
There's a word he's heard before!
Who is that again?
Karl.
a partner at the firm.
Karl's kind of a jerk.
You know what they say three times a charm!
Hey "dick wad".
I'm speaking.
Whooo!
Now.
There were times when we had our doubt about this gorgeous man.
But after careful observation over the last hundred years, my doubts are over.
So.
here's to the groom.
A man who finally got "Carrie-d" away.
Here's hopin', John!
Jackass.
Quite a toast, Samantha.
Well, you're quite a guy.
Steve.
I don't want to bother you all You're not bothering us.
But - I need to talk to Miranda.
Samantha, could you ask her to come out.
I don't want to go in.
It's a party and all.
Hi.
I haven't talked to you all night.
Steve's here.
Could you give us You didn't leave me any choice.
You won't return my calls You only talk to me in front of the baby when you know I can't say anything.
What could you possibly have to say that could make it better?
Miranda, please.
It was just that one time.
Please I love you You broke us!
You broke us.
What we had is broken!
I changed who I was for you.
Hey.
Are you alright?
No, I'm not alright.
You two are crazy to get married.
Marriage ruins everything.
There you are.
I thought you skipped out on me.
Well, the all-gal sleepover is about to commence.
You gonna miss me?
Don't go.
Spend the night with me.
Oh.
One night won't kill you.
And tomorrow you get to have me for the rest of your life.
Is everything okay?
I'm just tired I guess.
Go home and sleep.
Now, give me a kiss good night.
Make it good it's the last single girl kiss.
There we sat.
like a scene out of Louisa May Alcott's: "Not-so Little Women.
" I always knew she would marry Big.
Hello?
It's me.
Oh my God did you just hear Lily?
Hey I need to talk.
I'm sitting here trying to write these vows and.
Is this something we really want to do?
It's Big.

What's the matter?
It's just everything is great as it is.
I don't want to screw it up.

Go, go everyone out into the hall.
Hello?
It's Carrie.

Why aren't you calling me back?

Looks like someone had breakfast at Tiffany.
Sweetheart, look at the size.
it's breakfast, lunch and dinner at Tiffany.
This is Carrie, leave a message.
I'm out front waiting.
I can't go in without you.
Baby, this whole bride and groom thing has really thrown me.

Traffic was the worst Ready.
We're ready.

I have to go around the block.
By the time we go around the block she'll be gone.
No one's behind us - - Turn around!
I think this is them.
Pull over.
Pull over.
Carrie!
I did something really bad I think.
I said something to Big.
At the rehearsal dinner.
What do you mean?
It was right after Steve showed up.
I was upset.
Big came up to me and I said something like: You're crazy to get married.
It just came out.
Do you think it was totally the reason?
No, no, no.
Big has been weird about marriage for years.
I keep thinking I should tell Carrie.
No, no.
This is a really bad time to even mention it - no, no, no.
Find another time.
Later.
Well, turns out, I couldn't get her out of the honeymoon but I got us in.
What?
I just booked us three seats on the flight.

Now lets work on getting your things there.
You two could rule the world.
After her workout Charlotte couldn't help but think about how truly blessed she was.
This week had made her feel more grateful than ever for her happy marriage.
And while picturing her loved ones at home in New York, she forgot where she was.
And opened her mouth.
Hello Miss.
Sweetie what's That's locked Use the other And just like that, Charlotte Pookeepsed in her pants.

Anne From the New York Observer.

After only three days I began to think of her as Saint Louise from St.
Louis.
How hard could it be to find something just on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge?
On second thought Forget it.
I could do a better job myself.
According to New York Magazine, this is the new up-and-coming neighborhood.
See!

Is this you?
As much as Miranda wanted to pat herself on the back for finding her new apartment in just one afternoon.
in the end, she knew It was a Lovro connection.
That was really hot.
Hmmm.
You were kind of distant.
Maybe we need to make an effort to reconnect spend more time together away from the business.
Less me, less you More us.
So, I won't be coming to New York for a while.
We're going to spend some time reconnecting on the weekends.

You people and your relationships.
Please deposit another eighty-five cents.
Honey, a pay phone?
Where's your cell?
At the bottom of the ocean in Mexico.
Want me to hook you up with a new one?

Plus, It's an excuse to break out the gloves.
When Samantha Jones decides to do something.
She does it all the way.
She and Smith did all the upscale L.A. couple things.
Sushi.
Spray tanning.
And saving Somalia.
Samantha- style.
Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess.
Interesting so is Carrie Bradshaw.
Come on When are we going to get to the really important things like unpacking my closet?
One thing at a time.
Are you ever going to answer these emails?
Yes.
When?
Now?
Okay I'll read you tell me what to do.
Delete.
Right?
So right.
Who's John@jjpny.com.?
Oh, shit that's him, right?
Delete.
And isn't there some cyberspace place that you can send those so that I never have to see an email from him ever again?
Do that please.
You sure you want to end all communication with him?
"And Cinderella and Prince Charming lived happily ever after."
This is a fairy tall sweetheart.
Things don't always happen like this in real life you should know that now.
Again!
And another one bites the dust.
Mommie home!
Thanks for watching her while I went to the doctor.
Sure.
Everything okay?
I'm pregnant.
How?
My doctor said sometimes when women stop trying it can happen.
She knows other couples that adopt and then get pregnant.
Sweetie.
Carrie I'm pregnant!
I guess, in certain houses, fairy tales do come true.
I can't believe you're even dressing up.
And in the subject box: two words: I'm sorry.
Steve is all about "I'm sorry." 
I'm sorry emails I'm sorry voice mails I'm sorry flowers I'm sorry cards.
How about: don't do anything to be: "I'm sorry" for.
Maybe he's sorry.
Maybe Big is too.
Point taken.
I still can't believe this happened to me.
I know it happened, but I can't believe it happened.
I lay awake at night going over every detail of the last week in my head.
Carrie There's a detail I've been meaning to tell you about And then I saw it.
the only thing scary enough to scare me after the experience I'd been through.
You look great, you look amazing.
So.
That's the worst of it.
Wait what's that say?
In the box at the end?
"Editor's note: The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston was cancelled as this issue went to press.
Carrie Bradshaw is.
Is what?
"Carrie Bradshaw is still single and living in Manhattan."
I didn't want to buy it - but I figured it was one less Vogue in New York.
I saw it.
The pictures are gorgeous.
Yes I'm a beautiful bride.
Come in.
And what are you going to be for Halloween?
Cinderella.
Or we also brought Mulan.
Would you like to go trick or treating with us?
Yea!
Just in our building if you feel up to it.
Yea!
Yea!
No costume?
Look closer.
I'm the scariest thing in New York.
Jilted at Forty-one.
Boo.
You know you have to give me some of your loot, right?
Trick or treat!
Oh, Carrie, I saw Vogue I'm so sorry.
Trick or treat!
Louise!
Oh my Lord.
I did not even recognize you.
That's the point.
My head is the witness protection program.
I'm really feeling that look on you.
And I am feeling that Balenciaga on you.
Mine till Tuesday.
Here time to re-join the world.
Already?
Your new number.
area code: 347 Hold, Hold, Hold.
347?
No, no.
I'm a 917 gal.
Always have been.
No longer available.
Now, you're 347.
Great.
Now even I don't recognize me.
Samantha Jones.
Carrie Bradshaw  Or I used to be.
Talk to me.
I'm a 347 area code.
How tacky is that?
347 is the new New York.
I want the old New York with the old 917 and my old will to live.
Old New York, new New York honey at least it's New York.
Another hard thing about being in LA?
My "sex on a stick" next door neighbor.
I can't stop looking at him.
Looking?
Just looking.
After I saw Steve's face at the rehearsal dinner, I could never - But you should see this guy.
Every night sex with a different partner.
He's like Me.
Five years ago.
Yes.
When I was a 212.
It certainly wasn't the cutest dog in the pen - but their was something about it She needs a good a home.
Interested?
And just as Samantha convinced herself that the dog wasn't for her.
She's been fixed, but she hasn't lost the urge.
And she needs a little eye work.
Anything you can do about these stains?
Honey, I don't mince words.
Do you want me to get rid of it?
No, it's too beautiful.
I'll just bury it deep in the back like I did my feelings.
Do you miss him?
Every day.
You know, it's weird I haven't cried very much at all.
Maybe you're only allotted a certain amount of tears per man and I used mine up.
Yeah.
I know how you feel `cause, my college boyfriend broke up with me last year.
And I miss him all the time.
Suddenly, it dawned on me there were two broken hearts in my-walk in.
Louise we need a cocktail.
Grab your rental.
Why is that?
I don't feel like running!
Okay.
Welcome to the house of hormones.
It's all about the desk.
If I find the desk, the writing will come.
And it better `cause I'm using my new book advance to pay the fancy decorator.
I think it's so great that you are re-doing your entire apartment.
Out with the old  In with the overpriced.
Hey, Harry called me and mentioned you're not running.
Why'd he do that?
`Cause he loves you.
and he's concerned.
There is nothing to be concerned about.
Did the doctor say it wasn't safe or something?
There we are.
We're in the front row?
I pulled some strings.
Very nice.
I should go thank them Decide where we want to go for lunch I'll make the call.
It's like old times.
So, this is how you all spent your Saturdays while I was with Brady and Steve at the Brooklyn Aquarium.
Well.
Not every Saturday.
Just so you know We always had front row at the mammal show.
Steve does the funniest dolphin impression.
Actually, it's more Steve as a dolphin Let's get a cab I am starv Fur is murder!
MUR-DER.
MUR-DER.
God, I miss New York.
And a couple of weeks later I met St.
Louise's St.
Louis boyfriend, Will.
Over Christmas they realized how much they loved each other.
Just in time for Valentine's day.
Hello?
I'm just calling to make sure you aren't hanging from your shower rod.
You called an hour too early.
So, what's the V-day plan?
Miranda and I are going to dinner and then a really violent slasher movie.
Perfect.
And you?
I am making Smith sushi.
Pause for reaction.
Wow.
Do you make sushi?
We took a class a while back and when he walks in the door at seven- thirty, I am going to surprise him by laying on the dining room table - covered with homemade sushi.
Boy, you do have time on your hands.
Is it me or is Valentine's Day this year on steroids?
I think it was like this last year but we played for the other team.
Good evening.
Here's our special Valentine night menu.
All the selections are romantic in theme and designed to be split for two.
Are you having wine?
Yes.
A glass or a bot Bottle.
I'll be right back to take you and your girlfriends order.
I could do a lot worse.
Why would you look at the Vogue today of all days?
`Cause I'm an emotional cutter.
I deserve what I got.
Running all over New York believing that I'm finally getting my happy ending.
"See everyone, love does conquer all.
Look at me in my one of a kind wedding gown marrying the love of my life.
" Would you like another bot Yes.
And Miranda.
in that article I did not say "we" once.
It was all: "I" want and "I" think.
It was from your point of view.
My point of view.
Exactly.
The whole wedding was my point of view.
I let the wedding get bigger than Big.
I am the reason he didn't get out of that car.
It just happened I wasn't thinking.
Carrie, please Don't go I And I think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me.
I have never ever kept a secret from you.
Ever!
No, I'm lying.
For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve.
There.
How does it feel?
Excuse me!
Babe we're way behind on set.
I still haven't been released.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
It was the same Valentine night Samantha had planned minus the sushi.
I'm home!
Man, that was a long day the crew went into double overtime.
You are three hours late.
Bummer.
I know.
Did you eat?
Yes, I ate.
I ate the sushi that I hand made for you.
The sushi that I planned to lay all over my naked body as a Valentines surprise for you.
Why are you so upset?
I called.
I slaved away in a kitchen all day to make this meal for you.
No!
Come back here.
Where are you, baby?
Sorry I'm your neighbor and my dog ran up on your dick Deck!
Want to join me?
I'm Dante.
Stop by anytime.
Smith is interested - but the dates will have to work with the series.
We agreed that no one else from the show but Smith was going to be on the cover.
With her two weeks just about up, Miranda's list of pros and cons were equal.
It suddenly dawned on Miranda that Steve's list might have had more cons then pros.
And Miranda never looked back.
Well, almost never.
Kiss me.
And at home everything felt and looked different and yet still very much me.
Sorry.
This is a very exclusive party.
We're on the list.
Miranda Hobbes plus one.
and a half.
You have a dog!
Did you ever think you'd see the day me with a pooch.
So, she has a belly.
So what?
No, a belly on anyone else is a "so what?"
A belly on Samantha is a: "So what the hell is going on?"
She never mentioned it on the phone?
Never.
And when has she ever not talked about every detail regarding her body?
Should we even bring it up?
What like a fat intervention?
"We love you have a salad?"
No.
We should let her bring it up.
Ladies, we can talk about my gut later right now, I'm bored to tears here.
I eat so I won't cheat.
What exactly are you eating?
Everything except Dante's dick.
Language, please this is a grown- up apartment now.
I guess I didn't realize how big I was until I saw it on your faces.
How and I say this with love How could you not realize it?
I've been avoiding mirrors.
I'm proud of you for not cheating.
I don't know if there's anything to be proud of.
I stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me.
Why didn't you say something?
I guess I didn't want to admit it.
And when you're in denial you don't dial.
Now, listen this isn't about the weight.
You'd be gorgeous at any size.
But are you happy?
There we were.
the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid.
And Samantha?
That pillow cost three hundred dollars.
Hey You're home!
I thought you were staying the week.
We need to talk.
Awwww.
man.
I knew this was coming.
Yeah.
This isn't working.
I've done my best.
I've given it five years and fifteen pounds.
What You don't love me any more?
Yes, I love you - ah, fuck it I'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say I love you but I love me more.
And I've been in a relationship with myself for forty-nine years and that's the one I need to work on.
You'll find a wonderful woman who loves being in a relationship.
What will you find?
I don't know.
But that's a risk I'm willing to take.
No.
I'm keeping this.
Every time I look down at it I want to think of you.
We're landing in new York.
I'm gonna need to take that now.
As someone returned to my life.
Someone left.
And I put all the unopened mail from your P.O.
Box in the manila envelopes on the bottom shelf there.
Now, there were no more distractions.
And as I moved on.
Samantha moved in.
Hi, I'm your new neighbor.
Diego.
Samantha.
When are you due?
Next week.
You look gorgeous.
Oh, thank-you.
Hi, can I No, I'm sorry I can't stay Help me pull out the table.
I can't Charlotte.
Charlotte wait You're pregnant don't run.
I don't want to see you.
I'm so mad at you.
I was always on your side and then you did that to Carrie No, no I'm not going to cry I'm not going to waste tears on you I curse the day you were born!
I think my water just broke.
Oh my God Taxi!
My car's right there.
Get in my car.
I don't want to get in your car I hate your car.
Taxi!
Charlotte we need to get you to the hospital Please get in my car.
It's right here and ready.
Hi.
Congratulations.
A girl!
It's my lot in life to be surrounded by beautiful women.
Oh my God.
She's gorgeous.
Say hello to Rose.
What a beautiful name.
Well today is not about him.
It's about beautiful baby Rose.
So we know she has Charlotte's hair what else do we know?
She's a doll.
Mazel tov!
He asked me to ask you to call him.
I know!
It's none of my business.
But I felt bad for the poor schmuck hanging around the hospital waiting room hoping to see you.
I swear every time he heard someone in heels coming down the hall his heart stopped.
Harry it's so much more complicated than you can imagine.
I know it is and you have every right to never call him but I'm just a big pile of love today and I feel bad for the guy.
He said he's been writing you but you never responded.
He's never written me.
He said he wrote because he didn't have your phone number.
No.
He's never written me.
Ever.
Then, why would he say that he had?
Two hours, two manila envelopes and countless emails later, I was just about to give up on the Big riddle when I had told Louise to put Big in a place where I would never have to hear from him again.
There they were.
"The Love Letters of Great Men - Volume One."
Plus one more.
Written by John James Preston.
I wanted to call him - but our love.
Carrie and Big: volumes one, two, and three.
stopped me.
Hello.
I didn't hear my phone.
We are shopping for my wedding gown.
That one makes you look weird.
Momma can you please This is a work call.
No, it's okay I figured it out.
Well, I was going to call you anyway today is the final day on the Fifth Avenue apartment.
You have till six before they change the locks.
I don't need to go over there.
And do you NOT want those never- worn shoes?
Oh I completely forgot about `Cause if you don't send them on to me.
I'll squeeze my feet into them.
It's already five o'clock.
Hello?
There are never been worn four hundred dollar shoes!
Five twenty-five.
Bye.
Taxi!
The light in our pre-war apartment looked completely different post- war.
I was going to get these to you.
I didn't want it to be a total loss.
It wasn't logic it was love.
Why did we ever decide to get married?
I guess we were afraid it meant something if we didn't.
I'm sorry to have done that to you.
Carrie Bradshaw love of my life will you marry me?
See, this is why there's a diamond.
You need to do something to close the deal.
And in the end.
Carrie Bradshaw married John James Preston in a label-less dress.
By the power vested in me, by the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Ever thine.
Ever mine.
Ever ours.
You okay that it was just us?
Perfect.
You and me like I said.
Still.
Would have been nice if you had the girls here.
Which is why I called them.
Congratulations!
Mazel tov!
Excuse me excuse me!
You're not allowed to throw rice anymore.
Honey, get over it It's New York!
Who had the ham and eggs?
Wait wait a toast.
To Samantha.
fifty and fabulous!
To us.
and the next fifty!
To the next fifty.
And there, in the same city where they met as girls, four New York women entered the next phase of their lives.
dressed head to toe in love.
And that's the one label that never goes out of style.
