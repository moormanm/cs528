Isn't she the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?
She is a vision of perfection.
Her parents must have been truly good to receive such a treasure.
What are you two staring at?
We were just,
"You were just" what? Staring? Gawking? Why don't you go somewhere and mind your own business?
Forgive us, Princess.
We didn't mean to offend you. We humbly beg forgiveness.
Yeah, well forgive this.
Ha! Got them.
That'll teach them.
Must you treat the peasants that way?
I must!
Can't you behave like a lady?
I will, if you will!Quit acting like such a beast!
Don't call me names or I'll have Daddy chop off your head like he did to the rest of my tutors.
I meant it in the kindest way.
I'm just worried about you. You don't seem to care for anyone or anything. Someday you'll insult the wrong person and you'll be sorry.
No, it's them who will be sorry. Guards!
Take him away.
What? What did I do?
He bores me. Off with his head.
So what is on my schedule today?
Yes, Princess?
Read me my schedule.
Well, you have a hair appointment at 9, a dress fitting at 10, a,
Enough! I want to have a party instead.
But Princess,
 WHAT?
But of course, I'll go arrange it immediately.
Good scribe.  You always keep your head about you.
Yes, quite.What are you staring at?
Hello, sister. How are you this fair day?
Are you really that nice or are you just pretending?
What ever do you mean good sister?
You're always so sweet. Don't you ever get sick of being sweet?
Oh, sister, you always speak in such strange riddles. You always make me laugh.
And you always make me sick.
Where is your fair scribe off to?
He is preparing a party.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, what?
I already had a party planned.
You? You never have parties. You're not the popular one.
I know. I thought it was a silly idea too, but father insisted.
Whatever for?
Well, uh,
Well, uh, ?
You see, uh,
Out with it, girl!
There's this prince.
What prince?
Prince Andres of Acrime.
Never heard of him.
He is soon to be the king of Acrime.
Acrime? Where the devil is that?
Sister? Did you not learn your geography lessons?
Who cares about stupid geography?
Well, Acrime is the large kingdom East of here. Daddy says the kingdom is larger than ours.
Larger than ours?! Impossible.
You're probably right.
So why are you having a party for this prince?
Oh, I know! The party is for me! So I can meet Andres. And I spoiled the surprise. How horrible of me. Well, I will be sufficiently surprised when you introduce me.
Well, actually,
I know you don't want me to lie but it isn't really lying. We wouldn't want to disappoint father.
But,
I must hurry and get on my most lovely dress. I want to look my best for our guest. Not that I don't always look my best. I know one can't improve on perfect beauty, but I shall try.
Actually, the party was for me.
Ahhh. Poor Honor. That girl has put up with so much. Beauty has always treated her so badly, but Honor continues to be as kind as ever. I must do something for Honor. I must reward her for her goodness in some way. Maybe I could give her a golden
brush, a magic mirror. Oh, I know.
How about a handsome prince?
Yes, that should do nicely. That will infuriate Beauty for sure.
But how can I keep Beauty from stealing him? Oh, I know.
I'll make him blind. That will protect him from Beauty's powers.
Look! Over there. A stranger.
He looks like a prince.
That's Prince Andres of Acrime.
He's rich.
And powerful.
He must be here to see our Princess Beauty.
Or maybe he's here to see her sister, Honor.
But Beauty is so much prettier.
But Honor is so much nicer.
Maybe he's here to see us.
Dream on.
Good peasants.
Hello, good prince.
Is this the castle of the fair princess of Callentine?
Maybe. Which princess?
Oh, yes. There is more than one.
Beauty and Honor.
Yes. This is the castle I seek. Thank you good people.
Thank you good sir!
But he never said whom he was coming for.
I'm sure we'll find out. No one can ever keep a secret in this kingdom.
Why are you looking at me?
Come, we're late for the party.
I just love a party. They might as well call it a surprise party because Beauty is going to get the surprise of her life.
And she ain't gonna like it one bit.
 2 PARTY
Come dance the next dance, sister.
I don't want to mess up my dress.
But it's so fun.
There are some things more important than having fun.
Like what?
Go and enjoy yourself. I'll wait here for the prince to arrive.
He already has.
What? And he didn't say hi to me yet. Hasn't he spotted my absolute beauty? Hasn't he seen how radiant I am today?
Uh, Beauty.
What?
He hasn't seen anything.
What do you mean?
He's blind.
Blind? You mean he can't see?
I'm afraid not.
He can't even see my beautiful new dress?
I'm sorry.
Then, then I'll have to go talk to him.
That would be a lovely idea.
Yes, talk. I can do that.
Come. I'll introduce you.
Yes, yes. Okay. Just give me a minute.
I'll bring him over.
Oh, dear. What am I going to say? What can we
talk about? "What do you think of my hair?" No, I can't say that. "What do you think of my shoes?" No, that won't work either. What shall I do?
Andres. This is my sister, Beauty.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
So good to meet you too.
Uh, so. How do you like my, I mean, how do you like?
The party?
Yes.
It's wonderful. Especially the music. I love the music.
I hadn't noticed.
It's delightful.
Well, guess you want to run along.
Honor did say she was going to give me a tour of the kingdom after the party. I'm looking forward to it.
You are?
It's such a beautiful day outside. It should be lovely.
Your sister has been so kind to me. I wish I'd heard about your kingdom years ago.
Yes, me too.
Come, Andres. Let's have one more dance.
You can dance?
Well, not really.
But I can't either, so we make perfect partners.
We do!
Yes, I guess you do.
Some sister Honor is. She goes and steals my prince.
Well, I'll show her. When I'm declared Queen of the Ball, as usual, then Andres will realize who the best princess is.
Attention everyone! Attention!
We now must crown the Queen of the Ball.
And for the first time, the voting was unanimous. The envelope please.
And the winner is, Princess Honor.
 and  Hip-hip hurray! Hip-hip hurray.
This is such a special day for me. I will remember this always.
As our Queen of the Ball, you have the opportunity to make one royal decree.
No one can top my last one: a chance to vote on which dress I look best in. I spent a whole day modeling my dresses. What a chore.
As Queen of the Ball, I decree that tomorrow will be a holiday.
No work! Hurray.
And we will have a feast for  the people of our kingdom. Rich and poor.
Hurray!
And,
She's only allowed one thing. That's two.
We, we,
Tomorrow we will have a wedding. Honor has agreed to marry me.
What?
Hip-hip hurray! Hip-hip hurray!
I can't believe this. They didn't even notice me today. I might as well be invisible.
That can be arranged.
Hey! What did you just do?
I made you invisible.
You did?
I did. You have been the center of attention for too long. It's time you learned what it's like not to be noticed.
Who do you think you are?
I'm your fairy godmother.
Aren't you supposed to be nice to me?
I was once. I'm the one who made you beautiful when you were a baby. Now I'm here to correct my error.
Error. That was no error.
It was Beauty. You may be lovely on the outside but you
are ugly on the inside.
How dare you call me ugly!
You must stay invisible until you learn!
Invisible huh? This could be fun.
Oh, how lovely.
Oh, dear.
It's a ghost.
This is great!
Maybe I need to rethink this.
Perhaps there is another way.
Zippidy , wippidy , mippidy . do. You pick on servants and now they will pick on you!
 3
This is dreadful. Are you sure she is nowhere to be found?
I'm sorry, my king. We have looked everywhere. She has just disappeared.
This is all my fault.
No, it isn't.
Yes, I never should have hosted that ball. Beauty is the one who always has them. It's terrible of me to take that from her. She must be so mad at me.
You are just as able to have parties as she is. She has no right to be upset about that.
I must find her and talk to her. She must be devastated.
We will search everywhere for her, my princess. We won't stop until we find her.
Gather every available person. The search must begin immediately. A hundred pieces of gold to the one that finds her.
Yes, my king.
This is all going according to my plan. Yes, I have a plan, believe it or not. You think I'm making this up as I go along, don't you? Well, you'll see. This story will have a happy ending. I'll bet my wand on it. Now, to check on Beauty.
 4
(Outside the castle there is a strong man contest going on.
Different people compete, trying the lift various objects)
Now we're down to two men. Nick and Joe. Joe will go first.
No problem.
Now you, Nick.
I'll give it a try.
Nick is the winner!
Thank you everyone. You are too kind.
And your prize.
Five pieces of gold! That will feed my whole family for a month.
Congratulations.
Wow!
That's quite a prize.
You can say that again.
Do you need someone to help you spend it?
I plan using this to feed all my brothers and sisters.
Oh, you're no fun. Come on. Live a little. Let's throw a party.
I'm not going to waste this money on some silly party.
I'll dance every dance with you. I won't leave your side.
No, Jill. Forget it. I'd rather feed my family a month, then play for a day.
Would you do it for a kiss?
Good-bye, Jill.
Fine. Be that way. There are a million boys that like me.
I'll go dance with one of them.
You do that.
Jill certainly is a beautiful girl, Nick. How come you don't like her?
She doesn't understand how important this money is to my family.
I must say I admire you, my boy. Not many young men your age would give up everything for a bunch of little orphan kids.
As far as I know I haven't given up anything for them. My family and I have food, clothes, and a roof over our heads. What more could anyone want?
You got me there. Come, I want to introduce you to some friends of mine.
Where am I?
Who are you?
I'm Beauty.
That's a funny name.
What's so funny about it?
Well, you're not exactly,
Oh, what happened? Where are my lovely dresses? Who did this to me?
My fairy godmother did this. Where are you? I demand you come
to me immediately.
She's crazy.
Let's go, Meg.
See you later, crazy girl.
They should call her Ugly, not Beauty.
Yeah, well, if I weren't so nice, I'd call you a thing or two.
What seems to be the trouble?
Uh, hi. I seem to have been greatly wronged and am seeking restitution.
Oh,
Believe it or not, I am Princess Beauty.
What's so funny?
It's just that, you look nothing like her.
I know. My fairy godmother did this too me.
I thought fairy godmothers were supposed to be helpful.
So did I. Where is she?
This isn't funny, fairy godmother. If you don't turn me back now, you'll be sorry.
If you're really Beauty, why don't you just go home and tell them what happened? You can take a bath and get cleaned up and it will be okay.
That's an excellent idea.
Hello, you stupid servants. Let me in. It's Princess Beauty.
Get out of my way.
Sorry, but you're not Princess Beauty.
I am so.
You can't possibly be.
Step aside. I want to see my father.
No way! Back off.
Don't touch me.
And don't try that again or we'll throw you in the dungeon.
Now what am I going to do?
Do you have anywhere else to go?
No. No where.
Come with me. We'll get you cleaned up and fed. Then we'll decide what to do.
Have you seen any sign of my sister?
No, Princess.
No one else has seen her?
Oh, sure. Lots of people have come claiming the reward your father offered. They say she's anywhere from the stables to the moon. We even had one peasant come and claim she  Princess Beauty.
Really?
She looked nothing like her. She was all dirty and ugly.
Didn't you offer to help her?
Uh, well,
We should help all the people of our kingdom, especially those who are suffering.
I'm very sorry, Princess. I will not error again.
Please let us know immediately if there is any sign of Beauty.
Hey there! I found her. I found the Princess Beauty!
Here I am!
Well, well, well. Beauty has found herself a handsome peasant boy. A most unexpected development. A most unexpected and  peasant development. A day or so among the "little people" might be exactly what Beauty needs to see things differently. Now for the difficult part. I must teleport all of you into Nick's tiny home. It's much smaller than this castle here. If you don't mind I'll have to shrink you down a bit. You will be no bigger than mice. You must all agree to stay in hiding though. Oh, yes and watch out for the family cat. He gets awful hungry this time of day. Everyone ready? Here we go.
What happened to the lights? What's going on here? Did someone forget to pay the light bill? This is ridiculous.
Oh. I suppose all of you are more upset than I am about this. Now, no one panic. I've got everything under control.
I think.
 5
Here we are.
Oh.
What's wrong?
You live here?
That's right. You're used to your huge castle and all your fancy stuff.
You're making fun of me aren't you?
I'm sorry. It's just a little hard to believe you're the princess.
Well, I don't care what you think. I'll get along just fine without you.
Now, don't be like that. You're welcome to stay as long as you like. Aren't you hungry?
Just a little.
Then eat.
You are hungry.
Where's that big family of yours you told me about on the way over here?
They're probably out for their afternoon walk.
There they are now.
Hello, Nick!
Hello, family. I have great news.
You found a goose that lays golden eggs?
Almost as good. I won the strong man contest. I won five pieces of gold.
! Way to go.
That's wonderful. That can feed us for a year.
Well, maybe not a year, but it will sure help.
Who's this, Nick?
Is it your girlfriend?
This is a friend in need.
What's her name?
Beauty. My name is Beauty.
Don't laugh. Even though she may not be beautiful on the outside, she must be beautiful on the inside. That's the most important Beauty.
Well said, sister.
Children. Run along and do your chores. Dinner will be ready soon.
If only that were true. I'm afraid I'm ugly inside and out.
You mustn't say that.
But I am ugly on the inside. That's why I was turned ugly on the outside too, because that's all that was important to me.
Come with me. Let's fix you up and we'll see if we can't find that beauty again.
Yes?
I am the royal scribe. We are offering a reward for anyone who knows where Princess Beauty is. 100 pieces of gold.
100 pieces? That's a fortune!
So if you see her,
I will let you know.
Good day.
Uh, wait a minute. How do I know if it's her?
She's the most beautiful woman in the kingdom. You can't miss her.
But what if something happened? What if she got dirty or messed up somehow? How could you tell it was she?
That's a good question. Let me see, Oh, I know. She has a birthmark on her foot. You can't miss it when she takes off her shoes, which she rarely does. It's the one imperfection in her perfect beauty.
Thank you. I'll let you know.
Good day, then.
I wonder,
Who could that be?
Hi, Nick.
Oh, hi, Jill.
Aren't you happy to see me?
Well,
I decided to forgive you for insulting me today.
You have, huh?
Yes, you were such a brute to me, but I can't help myself. I still like you.
Lucky me.
So do you still want to go to the dance with me?
I already told you!
It won't cost us anything. I hear Princess Honor is paying for everything.
Princess Honor?
It's her wedding ball. Everyone is invited. And it's free!
I heard it was canceled.
What?!
Princess Honor refuses to get married until Beauty is found.
Leave it to Beauty to ruin my plans. I hope they never find her.
That's a terrible thing to say.
She's so mean and awful. The only good thing about her is
her looks.
I'm sure she's a good, honest person like the rest of us.
I doubt it.
So I guess we don't have to worry about the dance now.
I guess not. Do you want to go for a walk instead?
No, thanks.
Why not?
I have company.
You always have company.
Guess you'll be going then?
What's his name?
Whose name?
Your guest?
You mean, her name?
It's a "her?"
Actually, she says she's Princess Beauty but she looks nothing like her.
So do you like her?
I just met her.
But do you like her?
There's something about her, something special.
I can see I'm not wanted. I better go.
Please don't be mad, Jill.
But I thought you liked me?
I do, as, a friend.
But I'm so beautiful. How could you not like me?
There are more important things than beauty?
Fine, then. Good-bye, forever.
I'd be worried about her but she said the same thing to me last week.
Are you finished with your chores?
Are you washed up for dinner?
You know the rules. No washing. No dinner.
Wow. You look great.
What did you do, Janie?
A little scrubbing and a nice dress did a little bit of magic.
You're pretty.
Nick thinks so, too.
Run along kids and wash up.
What's wrong, Beauty?
I don't understand why you've been so kind to me.
I've never done anything for you. I don't have money to give you or anything else.
We are always willing to help those in need.
Before they died, mother and father made us promise to always help people.
Half these kids aren't even really our brothers and sisters. They're orphans.
Like us.
But why? You don't owe them anything.
There's more to life than owing people something.
I best go out and get the stew. It's cooking over the fire outside.
And Beauty can help serve.
Serve?
Would you mind?
I've never served anyone.
This is a good time to start.
Do I have to?
She's our guest Nick. She shouldn't need to.
Whatever you say.
I can't believe you.
What?
Janie was nice enough to clean you up and give you her best dress. Now you won't help her with dinner.
But I'm a princess. We don't serve.
You're a spoiled brat is what you are.
How dare you!
How dare you.
What about you?
Huh?
I don't see you serving either.
But I'm a man.
Well, who's the spoiled brat now?
That's different.
Oh, I see. The women serve the men. That's how it works.
It's no worse than  having to serve the princess.
It's a totally different thing all together.
Wait, wait. Let's not fight. I have an idea. Why don't we both go help Janie?
I suppose that would be a good compromise.
Let's do it.
There go Nick and his girlfriend.
He likes her doesn't he?
I'll bet he marries her.
He will not.
Will so.
Will not.
Dinner!
Sit children and we'll serve you.
I want Beauty to serve me.
I want Beauty to serve me too.
Me too.
Me first!
What do I look like? A servant?
She yelled at me!
Oh, golly.
It's okay, Jimmy. She didn't mean it.
Quiet! I can't stand all that noise.
Ah!
Now, look here. You can't go around and yell at my family.
We've tried to be nice to you and look how you treat us.
Fine, I'll leave.
Beauty. Please don't go.
I,
You can stay. I'll take care of you. I'll feed you and make you pretty dresses.
It doesn't matter what I do. You all still like me. I don't understand.
It's because you're beautiful.
Not anymore.
I can see it inside you.
Thank you.
Please let her stay.
  Please.
Only if she cleans up that bowl of stew she threw down.
I'll do it for her.
No. Only she can do it or she needs to go.
Please, Beauty. Please clean it up. We want you to stay.
I'm not mad at you. Please, don't leave.
Fine. I'll clean it up.
Yeah!
That's good enough.
No, she has to clean it all.
Hey, you know. This isn't so bad. In fact, it's almost fun. Give me a broom, I want to clean the rest of the room.
This is fun.
Okay, okay. You did it. You can stop now.
No, this is great. I've never had this kind of fun.
I've created a monster.
And clean she did. Beauty attacked every piece of dirt like she was dueling an evil, fire-breathing dragon. "Take that, dirt. Take that!" She had never done anything as difficult, or as fun, or as wonderful. She cleaned until the sun faded in the West and she couldn't see the end of the broom anymore. She was tired but happy, and forever transformed.
 6
( is sitting, her feet propped up on a chair. She is
Tired from cleaning. It is night. A candle is lit)
You're finally done?
I even cleaned the bottom of the table.
I can't believe it.
I've never enjoyed myself that much before. And I've never been this tired.
You were incredible. It would have taken us a week to do that much cleaning. You have paid us back and more.
Finally, a compliment.
I have been kind of hard on you.
Kind of? I've never been treated so poorly.
This was definitely a day of firsts for you.
You can say that again.
What's wrong?
My feet. They hurt so badly.
It's those shoes. They look too small for you.
Maybe so.
Can I take them off for you?
No, that's okay. I'm fine.
No, really. I'll rub them for you.
Oooh. A foot rub. How I miss those.
May I?
No.
Please.
Oh, I'm too tired to argue.
I'll have to warn you.
The birthmark.
Isn't it ugly?
Ah, aah,
Nick? What's wrong?
You're the princess!
I've been trying to tell you that.
Oh, your highness. I'm so sorry.
Nick, please don't grovel. That's why I liked you. You didn't feel like you had to treat me that way. I'm just a normal peasant girl now.
But why?
My stupid fairy godmother did this to me. Correction: My smart fairy godmother. She's made me like cleaning.
It worked, fairy godmother. It worked! I'm happy not being a beauty.
I never thought I could live without my beauty, but I guess I can.
Who said you weren't beautiful?
I look dreadful.
I don't think you look so bad.
Really?
Really. You look good enough to kiss.
What are you all doing in here? You're supposed to be in bed.
We wanted to see you kiss her.
Go back to bed.
Sorry about that.
That's okay.
So what do we do now?
I don't know.
Should I go get the Scribe? We can show him your birthmark and then you can go home.
And you can get your hundred gold pieces for
bringing me back home.
How did you know about that?
Janie told me.
I don't want any reward.
You're crazy not to take it.
I should be paying them a hundred pieces of gold for letting me spend time with you.
But I've been terrible to you and your family.
You may have upset me at times. But there's something about you. The way you are that makes me never want to let you go. It's not your beauty, it's you.
Oh, Nick.Your fairy godmother took the beauty on the outside and put it on the inside.
Thank you.
No, let's thank your fairy godmother.
You called?
There you are! I ought to.
Give you a big hug.
Well, this is certainly a change.
I can't thank you enough for what you've done.
Perhaps I over did it a bit.
I suppose you're going to change her back now.
I can and I will.
No, wait. I just got used to being this way.
But don't you want to be a princess?
But if I become a princess, I can't be with you.
You'd give all that up for me.
You and your family were so good to me. You're the first one to care for me for who I am, not what I look like. And I
feel so good. Before I just felt bad all the time.
Oh, what to do, what to do. Fairy godmother rules say I must change you back since you learned your lesson.
Can't you break them, just this once?
But what about your family, Beauty. They're worried about you. If you don't go back,
Oh, my goodness. I forgot about them. How awful of me.
Nobody's perfect.
Especially not me.
What will it be, Beauty?
Why can't I have both?
Both?
Both Nick and my family.
Beauty?
Yes, Nick.
You must go home.
But, Nick!
Your family needs you. I know what it's like to lose someone you love. It leaves an emptiness in your life that you can never fill. When my parents died,
If you think that's what's best!
I do.
But I don't want to become so mean and terrible again.
You can be any way you want to be now. I promise.
Then I better go.
I'll miss you, Beauty.
I'll miss you too.
Ready?
Ready.
Here we go!
It's so dark.
Something's wrong?
Are we home yet?
I'm afraid not.
I wonder who that is. I guess we'll never know because I can't
find the door.
Now what's the spell for turning on lights.
Clap on!
That was easy.
I've got the door.
It's me, Nick. I've brought someone.
Sister! Father!
Beauty? Is it really you?
What happened to you?
Something wonderful.
I don't understand.
I haven't been the nicest person in the world and my fairy godmother here decided to turn me inside out.
I'm so glad your safe.
I don't know what would have happened to me if it hadn't been for Nick.
Nick?
Yes, your highness.
Please rise.
Hello, children.
Are you really the king?
I'm really the king.
I don't believe you.
Cindy, show some respect.
That's okay. She seems like a sweet girl.
Thank you all for taking care of me. You've all been
so wonderful.
Are you leaving us?
Please, don't go.
She must go. She's a princess.
But, I can't just go back to the way I was. I like
my new life.
What are you saying? You don't want to come home?
I just don't want to be who I was before. I can never
be as good as Honor.
What do you mean?
Iï¿½m still not as beautiful as you are, sister. I don't think I ever can be.
But you are the most beautiful woman in the kingdom.
I used to think so, but not anymore. Now I think you've always been the most beautiful, we just couldn't see it.
I can return your beauty to you now.
No, I don't think I want my beauty anymore.
I think you're beautiful now.
Don't change, Beauty.
I don't think I will.
Father? Can't we let Beauty stay here?
My daughter? A peasant? Never.
Then why don't you get rid of the peasants.
What?!
That sounded terrible. What I mean is why don't you make all the peasants nobles, lords, and ladies? We can give them all some of our riches and they can all live as well as we do.
I suppose we could do that.
Oh, please, father.
Okay. Weï¿½ll do it!
Hurray!
We will open the royal treasuries. We'll give away all our excess clothes and food. No one will ever suffer in our kingdom again!
Hurray!
And we'll start with our friends Nick and Janie.
Please, your highness. We don't need anything. We are happy as we are.
What?
We have everything we need.
But you don't have silver plates and purple robes. You don't have golden chairs and fuzzy slippers.
All things we can live without.
How about no more taxes?
It's a deal.
No, no, no more taxes. Are you sure we can do that?
Yes, father. We can. We have more money than we know what to do with and soon I'll be married to Andres and living in his kingdom.
Then who will lead my kingdom?
Perhaps Nick would be willing.
Me?
You could make him a prince, father.
Me?
And then we could get married.
 and  Married?
Hurray!
I think it's a wonderful idea!
I think we're out voted, Nick.
It looks that way.
This is certainly one of the most unusual things that has ever happened in my kingdom.
You can say that again.
You sure this is what you want to do, Beauty.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
It looks like we're going to have a double wedding!
Hurray!
I get to be best man!
I get to be the maid of honor.
I want to be the flower girl.
What have I gotten myself into?
Isn't she the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?
She is a vision of perfection.
Her parents must have been truly good to receive such a treasure.
What are you two staring at?
We were just,
"You were just" what? Staring? Gawking? Why don't you go somewhere and mind your own business?
Forgive us, Princess.
We didn't mean to offend you. We humbly beg forgiveness.
Yeah, well forgive this.
Ha! Got them.
That'll teach them.
Must you treat the peasants that way?
I must!
Can't you behave like a lady?
I will, if you will!Quit acting like such a beast!
Don't call me names or I'll have Daddy chop off your head like he did to the rest of my tutors.
I meant it in the kindest way.
I'm just worried about you. You don't seem to care for anyone or anything. Someday you'll insult the wrong person and you'll be sorry.
No, it's them who will be sorry. Guards!
Take him away.
What? What did I do?
He bores me. Off with his head.
So what is on my schedule today?
Yes, Princess?
Read me my schedule.
Well, you have a hair appointment at 9, a dress fitting at 10, a,
Enough! I want to have a party instead.
But Princess,
 WHAT?
But of course, I'll go arrange it immediately.
Good scribe.  You always keep your head about you.
Yes, quite.What are you staring at?
Hello, sister. How are you this fair day?
Are you really that nice or are you just pretending?
What ever do you mean good sister?
You're always so sweet. Don't you ever get sick of being sweet?
Oh, sister, you always speak in such strange riddles. You always make me laugh.
And you always make me sick.
Where is your fair scribe off to?
He is preparing a party.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, what?
I already had a party planned.
You? You never have parties. You're not the popular one.
I know. I thought it was a silly idea too, but father insisted.
Whatever for?
Well, uh,
Well, uh, ?
You see, uh,
Out with it, girl!
There's this prince.
What prince?
Prince Andres of Acrime.
Never heard of him.
He is soon to be the king of Acrime.
Acrime? Where the devil is that?
Sister? Did you not learn your geography lessons?
Who cares about stupid geography?
Well, Acrime is the large kingdom East of here. Daddy says the kingdom is larger than ours.
Larger than ours?! Impossible.
You're probably right.
So why are you having a party for this prince?
Oh, I know! The party is for me! So I can meet Andres. And I spoiled the surprise. How horrible of me. Well, I will be sufficiently surprised when you introduce me.
Well, actually,
I know you don't want me to lie but it isn't really lying. We wouldn't want to disappoint father.
But,
I must hurry and get on my most lovely dress. I want to look my best for our guest. Not that I don't always look my best. I know one can't improve on perfect beauty, but I shall try.
Actually, the party was for me.
Ahhh. Poor Honor. That girl has put up with so much. Beauty has always treated her so badly, but Honor continues to be as kind as ever. I must do something for Honor. I must reward her for her goodness in some way. Maybe I could give her a golden
brush, a magic mirror. Oh, I know.
How about a handsome prince?
Yes, that should do nicely. That will infuriate Beauty for sure.
But how can I keep Beauty from stealing him? Oh, I know.
I'll make him blind. That will protect him from Beauty's powers.
Look! Over there. A stranger.
He looks like a prince.
That's Prince Andres of Acrime.
He's rich.
And powerful.
He must be here to see our Princess Beauty.
Or maybe he's here to see her sister, Honor.
But Beauty is so much prettier.
But Honor is so much nicer.
Maybe he's here to see us.
Dream on.
Good peasants.
Hello, good prince.
Is this the castle of the fair princess of Callentine?
Maybe. Which princess?
Oh, yes. There is more than one.
Beauty and Honor.
Yes. This is the castle I seek. Thank you good people.
Thank you good sir!
But he never said whom he was coming for.
I'm sure we'll find out. No one can ever keep a secret in this kingdom.
Why are you looking at me?
Come, we're late for the party.
I just love a party. They might as well call it a surprise party because Beauty is going to get the surprise of her life.
And she ain't gonna like it one bit.
 2 PARTY
Come dance the next dance, sister.
I don't want to mess up my dress.
But it's so fun.
There are some things more important than having fun.
Like what?
Go and enjoy yourself. I'll wait here for the prince to arrive.
He already has.
What? And he didn't say hi to me yet. Hasn't he spotted my absolute beauty? Hasn't he seen how radiant I am today?
Uh, Beauty.
What?
He hasn't seen anything.
What do you mean?
He's blind.
Blind? You mean he can't see?
I'm afraid not.
He can't even see my beautiful new dress?
I'm sorry.
Then, then I'll have to go talk to him.
That would be a lovely idea.
Yes, talk. I can do that.
Come. I'll introduce you.
Yes, yes. Okay. Just give me a minute.
I'll bring him over.
Oh, dear. What am I going to say? What can we
talk about? "What do you think of my hair?" No, I can't say that. "What do you think of my shoes?" No, that won't work either. What shall I do?
Andres. This is my sister, Beauty.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
So good to meet you too.
Uh, so. How do you like my, I mean, how do you like?
The party?
Yes.
It's wonderful. Especially the music. I love the music.
I hadn't noticed.
It's delightful.
Well, guess you want to run along.
Honor did say she was going to give me a tour of the kingdom after the party. I'm looking forward to it.
You are?
It's such a beautiful day outside. It should be lovely.
Your sister has been so kind to me. I wish I'd heard about your kingdom years ago.
Yes, me too.
Come, Andres. Let's have one more dance.
You can dance?
Well, not really.
But I can't either, so we make perfect partners.
We do!
Yes, I guess you do.
Some sister Honor is. She goes and steals my prince.
Well, I'll show her. When I'm declared Queen of the Ball, as usual, then Andres will realize who the best princess is.
Attention everyone! Attention!
We now must crown the Queen of the Ball.
And for the first time, the voting was unanimous. The envelope please.
And the winner is, Princess Honor.
 and  Hip-hip hurray! Hip-hip hurray.
This is such a special day for me. I will remember this always.
As our Queen of the Ball, you have the opportunity to make one royal decree.
No one can top my last one: a chance to vote on which dress I look best in. I spent a whole day modeling my dresses. What a chore.
As Queen of the Ball, I decree that tomorrow will be a holiday.
No work! Hurray.
And we will have a feast for  the people of our kingdom. Rich and poor.
Hurray!
And,
She's only allowed one thing. That's two.
We, we,
Tomorrow we will have a wedding. Honor has agreed to marry me.
What?
Hip-hip hurray! Hip-hip hurray!
I can't believe this. They didn't even notice me today. I might as well be invisible.
That can be arranged.
Hey! What did you just do?
I made you invisible.
You did?
I did. You have been the center of attention for too long. It's time you learned what it's like not to be noticed.
Who do you think you are?
I'm your fairy godmother.
Aren't you supposed to be nice to me?
I was once. I'm the one who made you beautiful when you were a baby. Now I'm here to correct my error.
Error. That was no error.
It was Beauty. You may be lovely on the outside but you
are ugly on the inside.
How dare you call me ugly!
You must stay invisible until you learn!
Invisible huh? This could be fun.
Oh, how lovely.
Oh, dear.
It's a ghost.
This is great!
Maybe I need to rethink this.
Perhaps there is another way.
Zippidy , wippidy , mippidy . do. You pick on servants and now they will pick on you!
 3
This is dreadful. Are you sure she is nowhere to be found?
I'm sorry, my king. We have looked everywhere. She has just disappeared.
This is all my fault.
No, it isn't.
Yes, I never should have hosted that ball. Beauty is the one who always has them. It's terrible of me to take that from her. She must be so mad at me.
You are just as able to have parties as she is. She has no right to be upset about that.
I must find her and talk to her. She must be devastated.
We will search everywhere for her, my princess. We won't stop until we find her.
Gather every available person. The search must begin immediately. A hundred pieces of gold to the one that finds her.
Yes, my king.
This is all going according to my plan. Yes, I have a plan, believe it or not. You think I'm making this up as I go along, don't you? Well, you'll see. This story will have a happy ending. I'll bet my wand on it. Now, to check on Beauty.
 4
(Outside the castle there is a strong man contest going on.
Different people compete, trying the lift various objects)
Now we're down to two men. Nick and Joe. Joe will go first.
No problem.
Now you, Nick.
I'll give it a try.
Nick is the winner!
Thank you everyone. You are too kind.
And your prize.
Five pieces of gold! That will feed my whole family for a month.
Congratulations.
Wow!
That's quite a prize.
You can say that again.
Do you need someone to help you spend it?
I plan using this to feed all my brothers and sisters.
Oh, you're no fun. Come on. Live a little. Let's throw a party.
I'm not going to waste this money on some silly party.
I'll dance every dance with you. I won't leave your side.
No, Jill. Forget it. I'd rather feed my family a month, then play for a day.
Would you do it for a kiss?
Good-bye, Jill.
Fine. Be that way. There are a million boys that like me.
I'll go dance with one of them.
You do that.
Jill certainly is a beautiful girl, Nick. How come you don't like her?
She doesn't understand how important this money is to my family.
I must say I admire you, my boy. Not many young men your age would give up everything for a bunch of little orphan kids.
As far as I know I haven't given up anything for them. My family and I have food, clothes, and a roof over our heads. What more could anyone want?
You got me there. Come, I want to introduce you to some friends of mine.
Where am I?
Who are you?
I'm Beauty.
That's a funny name.
What's so funny about it?
Well, you're not exactly,
Oh, what happened? Where are my lovely dresses? Who did this to me?
My fairy godmother did this. Where are you? I demand you come
to me immediately.
She's crazy.
Let's go, Meg.
See you later, crazy girl.
They should call her Ugly, not Beauty.
Yeah, well, if I weren't so nice, I'd call you a thing or two.
What seems to be the trouble?
Uh, hi. I seem to have been greatly wronged and am seeking restitution.
Oh,
Believe it or not, I am Princess Beauty.
What's so funny?
It's just that, you look nothing like her.
I know. My fairy godmother did this too me.
I thought fairy godmothers were supposed to be helpful.
So did I. Where is she?
This isn't funny, fairy godmother. If you don't turn me back now, you'll be sorry.
If you're really Beauty, why don't you just go home and tell them what happened? You can take a bath and get cleaned up and it will be okay.
That's an excellent idea.
Hello, you stupid servants. Let me in. It's Princess Beauty.
Get out of my way.
Sorry, but you're not Princess Beauty.
I am so.
You can't possibly be.
Step aside. I want to see my father.
No way! Back off.
Don't touch me.
And don't try that again or we'll throw you in the dungeon.
Now what am I going to do?
Do you have anywhere else to go?
No. No where.
Come with me. We'll get you cleaned up and fed. Then we'll decide what to do.
Have you seen any sign of my sister?
No, Princess.
No one else has seen her?
Oh, sure. Lots of people have come claiming the reward your father offered. They say she's anywhere from the stables to the moon. We even had one peasant come and claim she  Princess Beauty.
Really?
She looked nothing like her. She was all dirty and ugly.
Didn't you offer to help her?
Uh, well,
We should help all the people of our kingdom, especially those who are suffering.
I'm very sorry, Princess. I will not error again.
Please let us know immediately if there is any sign of Beauty.
Hey there! I found her. I found the Princess Beauty!
Here I am!
Well, well, well. Beauty has found herself a handsome peasant boy. A most unexpected development. A most unexpected and  peasant development. A day or so among the "little people" might be exactly what Beauty needs to see things differently. Now for the difficult part. I must teleport all of you into Nick's tiny home. It's much smaller than this castle here. If you don't mind I'll have to shrink you down a bit. You will be no bigger than mice. You must all agree to stay in hiding though. Oh, yes and watch out for the family cat. He gets awful hungry this time of day. Everyone ready? Here we go.
What happened to the lights? What's going on here? Did someone forget to pay the light bill? This is ridiculous.
Oh. I suppose all of you are more upset than I am about this. Now, no one panic. I've got everything under control.
I think.
 5
Here we are.
Oh.
What's wrong?
You live here?
That's right. You're used to your huge castle and all your fancy stuff.
You're making fun of me aren't you?
I'm sorry. It's just a little hard to believe you're the princess.
Well, I don't care what you think. I'll get along just fine without you.
Now, don't be like that. You're welcome to stay as long as you like. Aren't you hungry?
Just a little.
Then eat.
You are hungry.
Where's that big family of yours you told me about on the way over here?
They're probably out for their afternoon walk.
There they are now.
Hello, Nick!
Hello, family. I have great news.
You found a goose that lays golden eggs?
Almost as good. I won the strong man contest. I won five pieces of gold.
! Way to go.
That's wonderful. That can feed us for a year.
Well, maybe not a year, but it will sure help.
Who's this, Nick?
Is it your girlfriend?
This is a friend in need.
What's her name?
Beauty. My name is Beauty.
Don't laugh. Even though she may not be beautiful on the outside, she must be beautiful on the inside. That's the most important Beauty.
Well said, sister.
Children. Run along and do your chores. Dinner will be ready soon.
If only that were true. I'm afraid I'm ugly inside and out.
You mustn't say that.
But I am ugly on the inside. That's why I was turned ugly on the outside too, because that's all that was important to me.
Come with me. Let's fix you up and we'll see if we can't find that beauty again.
Yes?
I am the royal scribe. We are offering a reward for anyone who knows where Princess Beauty is. 100 pieces of gold.
100 pieces? That's a fortune!
So if you see her,
I will let you know.
Good day.
Uh, wait a minute. How do I know if it's her?
She's the most beautiful woman in the kingdom. You can't miss her.
But what if something happened? What if she got dirty or messed up somehow? How could you tell it was she?
That's a good question. Let me see, Oh, I know. She has a birthmark on her foot. You can't miss it when she takes off her shoes, which she rarely does. It's the one imperfection in her perfect beauty.
Thank you. I'll let you know.
Good day, then.
I wonder,
Who could that be?
Hi, Nick.
Oh, hi, Jill.
Aren't you happy to see me?
Well,
I decided to forgive you for insulting me today.
You have, huh?
Yes, you were such a brute to me, but I can't help myself. I still like you.
Lucky me.
So do you still want to go to the dance with me?
I already told you!
It won't cost us anything. I hear Princess Honor is paying for everything.
Princess Honor?
It's her wedding ball. Everyone is invited. And it's free!
I heard it was canceled.
What?!
Princess Honor refuses to get married until Beauty is found.
Leave it to Beauty to ruin my plans. I hope they never find her.
That's a terrible thing to say.
She's so mean and awful. The only good thing about her is
her looks.
I'm sure she's a good, honest person like the rest of us.
I doubt it.
So I guess we don't have to worry about the dance now.
I guess not. Do you want to go for a walk instead?
No, thanks.
Why not?
I have company.
You always have company.
Guess you'll be going then?
What's his name?
Whose name?
Your guest?
You mean, her name?
It's a "her?"
Actually, she says she's Princess Beauty but she looks nothing like her.
So do you like her?
I just met her.
But do you like her?
There's something about her, something special.
I can see I'm not wanted. I better go.
Please don't be mad, Jill.
But I thought you liked me?
I do, as, a friend.
But I'm so beautiful. How could you not like me?
There are more important things than beauty?
Fine, then. Good-bye, forever.
I'd be worried about her but she said the same thing to me last week.
Are you finished with your chores?
Are you washed up for dinner?
You know the rules. No washing. No dinner.
Wow. You look great.
What did you do, Janie?
A little scrubbing and a nice dress did a little bit of magic.
You're pretty.
Nick thinks so, too.
Run along kids and wash up.
What's wrong, Beauty?
I don't understand why you've been so kind to me.
I've never done anything for you. I don't have money to give you or anything else.
We are always willing to help those in need.
Before they died, mother and father made us promise to always help people.
Half these kids aren't even really our brothers and sisters. They're orphans.
Like us.
But why? You don't owe them anything.
There's more to life than owing people something.
I best go out and get the stew. It's cooking over the fire outside.
And Beauty can help serve.
Serve?
Would you mind?
I've never served anyone.
This is a good time to start.
Do I have to?
She's our guest Nick. She shouldn't need to.
Whatever you say.
I can't believe you.
What?
Janie was nice enough to clean you up and give you her best dress. Now you won't help her with dinner.
But I'm a princess. We don't serve.
You're a spoiled brat is what you are.
How dare you!
How dare you.
What about you?
Huh?
I don't see you serving either.
But I'm a man.
Well, who's the spoiled brat now?
That's different.
Oh, I see. The women serve the men. That's how it works.
It's no worse than  having to serve the princess.
It's a totally different thing all together.
Wait, wait. Let's not fight. I have an idea. Why don't we both go help Janie?
I suppose that would be a good compromise.
Let's do it.
There go Nick and his girlfriend.
He likes her doesn't he?
I'll bet he marries her.
He will not.
Will so.
Will not.
Dinner!
Sit children and we'll serve you.
I want Beauty to serve me.
I want Beauty to serve me too.
Me too.
Me first!
What do I look like? A servant?
She yelled at me!
Oh, golly.
It's okay, Jimmy. She didn't mean it.
Quiet! I can't stand all that noise.
Ah!
Now, look here. You can't go around and yell at my family.
We've tried to be nice to you and look how you treat us.
Fine, I'll leave.
Beauty. Please don't go.
I,
You can stay. I'll take care of you. I'll feed you and make you pretty dresses.
It doesn't matter what I do. You all still like me. I don't understand.
It's because you're beautiful.
Not anymore.
I can see it inside you.
Thank you.
Please let her stay.
  Please.
Only if she cleans up that bowl of stew she threw down.
I'll do it for her.
No. Only she can do it or she needs to go.
Please, Beauty. Please clean it up. We want you to stay.
I'm not mad at you. Please, don't leave.
Fine. I'll clean it up.
Yeah!
That's good enough.
No, she has to clean it all.
Hey, you know. This isn't so bad. In fact, it's almost fun. Give me a broom, I want to clean the rest of the room.
This is fun.
Okay, okay. You did it. You can stop now.
No, this is great. I've never had this kind of fun.
I've created a monster.
And clean she did. Beauty attacked every piece of dirt like she was dueling an evil, fire-breathing dragon. "Take that, dirt. Take that!" She had never done anything as difficult, or as fun, or as wonderful. She cleaned until the sun faded in the West and she couldn't see the end of the broom anymore. She was tired but happy, and forever transformed.
 6
( is sitting, her feet propped up on a chair. She is
Tired from cleaning. It is night. A candle is lit)
You're finally done?
I even cleaned the bottom of the table.
I can't believe it.
I've never enjoyed myself that much before. And I've never been this tired.
You were incredible. It would have taken us a week to do that much cleaning. You have paid us back and more.
Finally, a compliment.
I have been kind of hard on you.
Kind of? I've never been treated so poorly.
This was definitely a day of firsts for you.
You can say that again.
What's wrong?
My feet. They hurt so badly.
It's those shoes. They look too small for you.
Maybe so.
Can I take them off for you?
No, that's okay. I'm fine.
No, really. I'll rub them for you.
Oooh. A foot rub. How I miss those.
May I?
No.
Please.
Oh, I'm too tired to argue.
I'll have to warn you.
The birthmark.
Isn't it ugly?
Ah, aah,
Nick? What's wrong?
You're the princess!
I've been trying to tell you that.
Oh, your highness. I'm so sorry.
Nick, please don't grovel. That's why I liked you. You didn't feel like you had to treat me that way. I'm just a normal peasant girl now.
But why?
My stupid fairy godmother did this to me. Correction: My smart fairy godmother. She's made me like cleaning.
It worked, fairy godmother. It worked! I'm happy not being a beauty.
I never thought I could live without my beauty, but I guess I can.
Who said you weren't beautiful?
I look dreadful.
I don't think you look so bad.
Really?
Really. You look good enough to kiss.
What are you all doing in here? You're supposed to be in bed.
We wanted to see you kiss her.
Go back to bed.
Sorry about that.
That's okay.
So what do we do now?
I don't know.
Should I go get the Scribe? We can show him your birthmark and then you can go home.
And you can get your hundred gold pieces for
bringing me back home.
How did you know about that?
Janie told me.
I don't want any reward.
You're crazy not to take it.
I should be paying them a hundred pieces of gold for letting me spend time with you.
But I've been terrible to you and your family.
You may have upset me at times. But there's something about you. The way you are that makes me never want to let you go. It's not your beauty, it's you.
Oh, Nick.Your fairy godmother took the beauty on the outside and put it on the inside.
Thank you.
No, let's thank your fairy godmother.
You called?
There you are! I ought to.
Give you a big hug.
Well, this is certainly a change.
I can't thank you enough for what you've done.
Perhaps I over did it a bit.
I suppose you're going to change her back now.
I can and I will.
No, wait. I just got used to being this way.
But don't you want to be a princess?
But if I become a princess, I can't be with you.
You'd give all that up for me.
You and your family were so good to me. You're the first one to care for me for who I am, not what I look like. And I
feel so good. Before I just felt bad all the time.
Oh, what to do, what to do. Fairy godmother rules say I must change you back since you learned your lesson.
Can't you break them, just this once?
But what about your family, Beauty. They're worried about you. If you don't go back,
Oh, my goodness. I forgot about them. How awful of me.
Nobody's perfect.
Especially not me.
What will it be, Beauty?
Why can't I have both?
Both?
Both Nick and my family.
Beauty?
Yes, Nick.
You must go home.
But, Nick!
Your family needs you. I know what it's like to lose someone you love. It leaves an emptiness in your life that you can never fill. When my parents died,
If you think that's what's best!
I do.
But I don't want to become so mean and terrible again.
You can be any way you want to be now. I promise.
Then I better go.
I'll miss you, Beauty.
I'll miss you too.
Ready?
Ready.
Here we go!
It's so dark.
Something's wrong?
Are we home yet?
I'm afraid not.
I wonder who that is. I guess we'll never know because I can't
find the door.
Now what's the spell for turning on lights.
Clap on!
That was easy.
I've got the door.
It's me, Nick. I've brought someone.
Sister! Father!
Beauty? Is it really you?
What happened to you?
Something wonderful.
I don't understand.
I haven't been the nicest person in the world and my fairy godmother here decided to turn me inside out.
I'm so glad your safe.
I don't know what would have happened to me if it hadn't been for Nick.
Nick?
Yes, your highness.
Please rise.
Hello, children.
Are you really the king?
I'm really the king.
I don't believe you.
Cindy, show some respect.
That's okay. She seems like a sweet girl.
Thank you all for taking care of me. You've all been
so wonderful.
Are you leaving us?
Please, don't go.
She must go. She's a princess.
But, I can't just go back to the way I was. I like
my new life.
What are you saying? You don't want to come home?
I just don't want to be who I was before. I can never
be as good as Honor.
What do you mean?
Iï¿½m still not as beautiful as you are, sister. I don't think I ever can be.
But you are the most beautiful woman in the kingdom.
I used to think so, but not anymore. Now I think you've always been the most beautiful, we just couldn't see it.
I can return your beauty to you now.
No, I don't think I want my beauty anymore.
I think you're beautiful now.
Don't change, Beauty.
I don't think I will.
Father? Can't we let Beauty stay here?
My daughter? A peasant? Never.
Then why don't you get rid of the peasants.
What?!
That sounded terrible. What I mean is why don't you make all the peasants nobles, lords, and ladies? We can give them all some of our riches and they can all live as well as we do.
I suppose we could do that.
Oh, please, father.
Okay. Weï¿½ll do it!
Hurray!
We will open the royal treasuries. We'll give away all our excess clothes and food. No one will ever suffer in our kingdom again!
Hurray!
And we'll start with our friends Nick and Janie.
Please, your highness. We don't need anything. We are happy as we are.
What?
We have everything we need.
But you don't have silver plates and purple robes. You don't have golden chairs and fuzzy slippers.
All things we can live without.
How about no more taxes?
It's a deal.
No, no, no more taxes. Are you sure we can do that?
Yes, father. We can. We have more money than we know what to do with and soon I'll be married to Andres and living in his kingdom.
Then who will lead my kingdom?
Perhaps Nick would be willing.
Me?
You could make him a prince, father.
Me?
And then we could get married.
 and  Married?
Hurray!
I think it's a wonderful idea!
I think we're out voted, Nick.
It looks that way.
This is certainly one of the most unusual things that has ever happened in my kingdom.
You can say that again.
You sure this is what you want to do, Beauty.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
It looks like we're going to have a double wedding!
Hurray!
I get to be best man!
I get to be the maid of honor.
I want to be the flower girl.
What have I gotten myself into?
This is so stupid can we go now? It's Saturday night and there's other places I'd rather be
You'll never guess who she said I was in one of my past lives.
Let's see. Cleopatra?
How did you know?
Psychic's always say women were Cleopatra For some reason, everyone wants to be her. Personally, I'd rather have been someone longer lived. What a way to go. Snake bite to the breast. Ouch.
You don't think it's true?
Heather, these people aren't for real. Don't you read the disclaimers?
For entertainment purposes only.
She seems so real so convincing
Oh, sorry. I didn't know anyone was still here?
Yeah, she's real perceptive.
Does you friend want a reading?
Yes!
No!
Come on, Brenda. I'll pay for it.
Don't waste your money.
It's just for fun. You said it yourself: for entertainment purposes only. What do you have to fear?
Fear itself?
Come, come. I won't bite.
Yeah, but I might.
There, I paid for it.
I feel my power returning to me.
The power of the U.S. Mint.
Go on.
Fine, let's get this over with.
The spirits come to me.
Leave the curtain open. I want witnesses.
You sure you want me to watch. It gets kind of private.
Private? Then I definitely want you to watch.
So what do you want to know?
The quickest way out of here.
Don't be difficult, Brenda. Try to have fun with it.
Fine. What are this week's winning lottery numbers?
3-5-9-20-25-49 and the Powerball is
7.
Pretty specific.
Why didn't I think to ask that?
What else do you see in the cards?
I see your past and your future.
Let me guess. I was Cleopatra too. How is it possible for so many people to be Cleopatra? I know maybe she had a split personality.
I'm afraid in your past you were nobody famous.
Nobody? Ever?
Never ever.
What about my future?
You will be famous one day.
Now or in a future life.
Would you like to be famous in this life?
What do you mean?
In everyone's life cycles, they are allowed one time to be famous.
Only once huh?
Do you wish it to be this one?
Sure, why not?
Then so be it!
That was weird.
Where'd she go?
Behind the curtain no doubt.
It's solid wall behind here.
Then through a trap door. It doesn't matter. Let's go.
You have to admit. That was pretty spooky.
And completely fake.
"You can only be famous once in your life cycles."
What a fraud. She's not even a good fake psychic.
Oh, hey! Aren't you that actress?
Who? Me?
Yeah, the one is the play downtown. What's it called? A Brush with Destiny. That's it.
Did you see her?
Yeah, you were incredible.
Thanks.
Did you see the review in today's paper?
You got a review?
That reviewer is an idiot. He wouldn't know a play if a stage fell on him.
Oh, my gosh. This review is really good.
You're kidding. He never likes anything.
He sure liked you.
Brenda Star lives up to her name. Her radiant talent brightens this otherwise ordinary play.
Let me see that.
This is so great! My agent will go nuts.
Maybe I better get your autograph. Sounds like you're going to make it big.
Here.
There you go.
Thanks.
I guess Madame Mooch stepped out. I'll come back later.
We better go get a copy of the paper so you can show your agent.
Wait a minute. This smells like a set up.
What do you mean?
Wasn't that awfully good timing? She says I'm going to be famous and then this guy comes in here and acts like I'm some new star.
But how could she fake that newspaper review?
Good point.
So do you think there might be something to this psychic thing?
It's a coincidence. That's all.
Hello? Hi, Gina.
It's my agent.
I'll bet she saw the review.
Yeah, I read it.
Very good.
What?
No way.
What is it? What?
Shhhh.
Sorry, my friend is talking to me.
Yes, let's do it.
I hate to admit this, but I'm at some psychic reading place.
Madame Mooch
You know her.
Gina's been here.
Sure I'll wait for you here.
You won't believe this.
Probably not, but tell me anyway.
Somebody is filming a movie in town and they saw my show last night. They want me to be in their movie.
You're kidding.
Gina said there are some big stars in it too. One of them had a scheduling conflict and can't come. Gina's bringing the casting director over to see me now. They need somebody immediately and want me to do it.
You'll be famous!
This can't be happening. Where is that Madame Money?
Mooch.
Whatever. Come out, Madame! I want a word with you.
Why are you upset? This is wonderful.
I know how these stories go. Remember that story the Monkey's Paw? At first, everything is great. You get everything you wish for, then the bottom drops out.
You are such a wet blanket. Can't you have a little fun?
Fun is for people who are too stupid to prepare for the impending disaster.
I give up. Fine, don't enjoy your instant success. I'm going home.
Don't be mad, Heather. I'm sorry. I have to admit there might be something beyond my comprehension going on here.
See! Isn't this stuff amazing?
Or extremely well contrived.
Madame Mooch. I need a word with you.
I wonder why she isn't reappearing.
I'm not speaking her language.
I have something green for you.
I sense that you require my services.
I need some information.
Information is my middle name, though my abilities have been weakened by all the recent activity.
There. Feeling better?
A bit better, yes.
Good.
I sense your friend here wants to go.
Do you?
Oh, my gosh. I have reservations for five minutes ago.
Thank you, Madame Mooch. Bye Brenda.
That was my money. How come she got a reading?
She paid for you. You paid for her.
Now for my question
My power is fading.
Feel better?
Ask your question.
How can Madame Mooch cook up such an elaborate scam?
Madame Mooch didn't scam you. You want to be famous, so you will be famous.
What if I've changed my mind?
It is your destiny now. Don't fight it. Fighting it will only bring doom upon you.
Doom. That's certainly what I'm expecting from all this. Every silver lining has a cloud.
I predict that your bad fortune is over.
I hope you're right.
Unless
There's always an unless Okay, give me the bad news.
I must consult the cards.
That's probably going to cost me.
The meaning of these cards escape me
Ah, yes. I see now. Beware the one armed bandit.
You mean slot machines? That's easy. I hate gambling. Ever since that time my boyfriend got kidnapped by a trucker at Sky City Casino, I've refused to go back to one.
Beware. Beware the one armed bandit.
Yeah, yeah. You said that already.
Wait. I have more questions.
No time. You have visitors.
How did she know that?
Hey, Brenda. How's my big star?
Still in wonder
I want you to meet someone.
This is Barry Bandito. He's the casting director for the movie I told you about.
Bandito? Oh
Uh hi
Brenda. I thought you'd be more excited. This is a big opportunity.
Sorry, this has all been very sudden.
Brenda is new to the theatre scene.
She's a natural. She appears to have years of experience.
So will she work, Barry?
He wanted to meet you before he decided on anything.
I'd like to interview you a bit first.
Yes, I have a few questions also.
We can sit over here.
What is your problem? Get excited.
I have a bad feeling about this guy.
Brenda shush
Would you like to go first or shall I?
I'll go first.
Barry is on a tight schedule. Maybe you ought to let him
No, I like a woman of action. Go ahead Brenda.
I'm going to be frank
Brenda ixnay on the
Why would a big studio want a little small time nobody like me?
You have the look
The look?
You know, the look.
Perhaps you could explain the look to me a bit more?
You have that natural spark that will light up the screen
She does have a spark, doesn't she? La Chizpa as they say.
You are very attractive. I could take you far.
I'd rather you didn't take me anywhere.
Brenda!
She's so funny, isn't she?
I don't need a comedian.
I need someone who takes direction well.
Depends on the director.
I thought you said she really wanted this part.
She told me she did.
How big of a part is this?
That depends on you.
What does that mean?
Wait. I thought you said this was a big part.
So far, today, I'm not seeing what I want
Maybe this was a mistake
No, wait. I don't understand. I thought we had an agreement.
Sorry, I can already tell it's not going to work out.
But
Wait
Let him go, Gina.
What was that all about?
That guy totally gave me the creeps.
But I really went on a limb on this one for you
I'm sorry, but I don't think he was interested in my acting skills.
Look, Brenda. What did you expect? Being a star involves give and take.
Sorry, but I don't want to give what he wants to take.
Then maybe you need to find another agent.
What?
Maybe Morality Movie Studio is looking for actresses. Oh, wait. There's no such thing. See you, Brenda. Thanks for nothing.
Wow, Madame Mooch. You sure were right about this one.
Wow, Gina sure didn't look happy. What happened?
I just blew my chance at fame and fortune.
Why'd you do that?
Forget it. What are you doing back here?
Dan called and canceled our dinner date so went I bought a lottery ticket. I used Madame Mooch's numbers.
That was a waste of a dollar.
It was worth a try.
Let's go, okay?
I can't wait any longer.
Where's Madame Mooch?
In her secret room laughing at us no doubt.
Can we get by please?
I want to see Mooch now!
All you have to do is wave a few dollars around. She'll appear.
Maybe if I wave this instead
He's got a gun!
Hey, now buddy. We don't want any trouble.
Well, that's what you're going to get unless I see Mooch.
My guess is that she's heading out the back door as we speak.
Afraid not. I blocked her back door with my car.
I don't know what your problem with her is, but it has nothing to do with us. So if we could just go
You're witnesses now. You stay.
Witnesses?
To a crime.
You know what? No crime has been committed. As far as I can tell, you have a permit for that gun. No crime. No problem. Let's go, Heather.
Both of you sit down now!
Come out here, Mooch before I start shooting into those rice paper walls of yours. There's no telling what I'll hit.
Hello, Joe. What do you want?
Oh, great. Now we know his name. So much for not being a witness.
I want my life back, Mooch. The one you stole from me.
She stole your life?
She told my wife that I was sleeping around and then my wife left me.
I can not hide the truth.
But that wasn't the truth. I've been faithful to my wife.
Have you?
I've never slept with anyone else since I married her.
What about Megan?
Megan? You mean my old girlfriend?
Did you sleep with her?
Not since I've been married.
Oh, dear. I guess my visions got crossed.
"Oh, dear." Is that all you can say?! You ruined my life and you just say, "Oh, dear."
I can't believe your wife would leave you based on something some two-bit psychic would say.
How dare you call me a
Shut up, Mooch.
She had some help. After Mooch told my wife about Megan, my wife paid Megan a visit. Megan never got over our breakup so she has some hard feelings. So Megan told my wife that Mooch was right.
That's not good.
So between Mooch here and Megan, your wife was sure you were lying.
So psychic lady, can you see what's in your future?
Sorry, I can't predict the future for myself.
Well, let me give you some help.
Where'd I put my gun clip?
Run, Heather!
What about Mooch?
We'll call the cops.
Hold it!
Turn around and come back slowly.
We're gonna die.
Quit blubbering and sit down.
Are you going to kill us?
No, I don't want to kill anyone.
It looked like you wanted to kill Mooch.
I only wanted to scare her.
I think you succeeded. Can we go now?
I was hoping it would be enough. But still, I don't feel like
I think we have a problem.
Who called the cops?
We didn't.
Mooch must have called them before she came out. Now what do I do?
Surrender. You haven't really done anything yet.
Am I still alive or has someone summoned my spirit?
Unfortunately you're still among the living. Now get up before that changes.
I see the police have arrived.
No thanks to you.
I saw danger in my future so I took the liberty of calling them.
Isn't she amazing?
Perhaps you can see a way out of this for me.
Give yourself up. It's the only way.
Now I think there's a news crew.
Oh, think of all the publicity.
I have to know what's going on out there. Turn on your , Mooch.
We're live outside Madame Moose's shop
Mooch not Moose.
I think I like Moose better.
The police say the suspect is armed and dangerous.
That doesn't sound good.
Maybe if you tell them your story then they'll go easy on you.
That might give me some satisfaction being able to tell the news what a big fraud she is.
Can't you shoot me in the foot and run. That would be much better for business.
How about I shoot you in the foot  talk to the reporter.
Shhh. Wait. They have the lottery numbers at the bottom of the screen.
Heather. Can't that wait?
Three! I've got a three.
Heather please not
Five! Got a five!
Heather
Nine! We've got three numbers.
You've got to be kidding.
Twenty! We're winning!
Twenty-five. We have twenty-five.
49!
And the Powerball is
Seven! We won!
I told you so.
We won! We won!
So how much did you win?
Not much.
Only 95 million.
95 million! Dollars?
No, Powerballs.
Shut up!
This changes everything.
Hand over the ticket.
Easy come easy go.
No
No, what?
No, I'm not giving him our ticket. This is our ticket.
Heather, this is no time to get a backbone.
But we won it. It's ours.
It's amazing what a few million can do to a person.
Hand it over or I'll take it off your dead body.
Oh, Joe!
He didn't see that coming.
So what do you girls say to sharing that ticket.
Sure! I think I could spare a million or two.
It's the least we could do. I assume there's a "we" in this deal.
Of course, I wouldn't have bought this without you.
I have to ask you, Mooch, are you always picking winning numbers?
Never. I got lucky this time.
Incredible.
I think we better go get the police before Joe wakes up.
I'll get them. Keep an eye on him.
What a story. Those reporters will be all over us.
We'll be famous.
